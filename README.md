# Credential Tiers

Credential Tiers is a native [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) plugin that manages Codex and Antigravity credentials through four clear tiers: Primary, Regular, Backup, and Paused.

The embedded Management Center page uses named policies instead of numeric scores and provides quota refresh, filtering, previews, manual overrides, and an audit history. It reuses the Management Center's saved sign-in state and never asks for or persists a second copy of the management key.

## Features

- Four policies: quota bands, balanced rotation, reset-soon first, and manual primary/backup.
- Codex quota bands evaluate the 5-hour and weekly windows separately, then use the lower tier. Weekly-only credentials use only the weekly bands.
- Codex defaults: 5-hour Primary `>=50%`, Regular `>=20%`; weekly Primary `>=20%`, Regular `>=5%`. Positive balances below Regular are Backup; an exhausted window is Paused. All four thresholds are configurable in the page.
- Antigravity retains its original bands: Primary `>=50%`, Regular `20–49%`, Backup `1–19%`, Paused `0%`.
- A failed quota probe keeps the last known result until the configured consecutive-failure threshold is reached.
- Paused credentials use CPA priority `-1` rather than writing `disabled=true`, so a later quota reset can restore them automatically.
- Credential updates preserve the complete auth document and change only CPA priority.
- Nested backup files are excluded from scheduling and writeback.
- Credentials within the same tier remain available to CPA's normal round-robin selection.

## Installation

Install **Credential Tiers** from CLIProxyAPI's Plugin Store, or download the archive for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/William-zgx/cpa-plugin-credential-tier-router/releases/latest).

Release archives use this format:

```text
credential-tier-router_<version>_<goos>_<goarch>.zip
```

Extract the dynamic library at the archive root into CPA's matching plugin directory, for example:

```text
plugins/linux/amd64/credential-tier-router.so
```

Enable the plugin in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  configs:
    credential-tier-router:
      enabled: true
      auto_apply: false
      strategy: quota_bands
      interval_minutes: 15
      provider_scope: codex|antigravity
      antigravity_group: gemini
      failure_threshold: 3
      codex_5h_primary_min: 50
      codex_5h_regular_min: 20
      codex_weekly_primary_min: 20
      codex_weekly_regular_min: 5
```

Start with `auto_apply: false`, open **Credential Tiers** in Management Center, refresh quota, and review the preview before enabling automatic writeback.

## Policies

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Quota bands | Assign tiers from remaining quota. |
| Balanced rotation | Keep healthy credentials in one tier and let CPA rotate them. |
| Reset-soon first | Prefer credentials that reset within 24 hours and still have quota. |
| Manual primary/backup | Apply a fixed named tier to each credential. |

The plugin currently manages `codex` and `antigravity` auth files. For Antigravity, the UI can evaluate either the Gemini quota group or the Claude/GPT quota group.

### Codex window-aware quota bands

Window types are identified from `limit_window_seconds` (`18000` for 5 hours, `604800` for a week), not their primary/secondary position or the account's subscription name. For example, 80% remaining in 5 hours and 15% remaining in the week produces Regular; a weekly-only account at 30% produces Primary.

Each threshold pair must satisfy `1 <= regular < primary <= 100`, using integer percentages. Existing settings and state files automatically receive the new defaults. As before, reported percentages are rounded upward to integers. The page shows each window's balance and reset time, plus the reason for the resulting tier. Balanced, reset-soon and manual policies continue to use the aggregate quota behavior.

An unsupported duration, a malformed present window, or disappearance of a previously observed window is a failed probe, not evidence of unlimited quota. Failures retain the last result until the failure threshold, then keep the current tier with an unknown balance. Known window types survive this failure transition and restarts. An account with a valid weekly window and no other window on its first successful probe can be treated as weekly-only; the API cannot prove whether an unobserved window was omitted. After an intentional subscription change removes a previously known window, reset that credential's entry in the plugin's quota cache while CPA is stopped. Legacy aggregate-only cache entries cannot determine the new Codex tiers until a successful window-aware probe.

Preview uses the edited settings without saving them or starting automatic scheduling. **Save and apply** persists the settings and writes the new priorities. Once plugin settings have been saved, the plugin state is authoritative; editing the host YAML alone does not override saved page settings.

## Build

Go 1.24 and a C compiler are required because CPA's native plugin ABI uses cgo.

```bash
make test
make vet
make package VERSION=0.1.2
```

The package target writes a platform zip and checksum into `dist/`.

## Security

- Management API requests require CPA's management key.
- The embedded page reads the Management Center's same-origin saved sign-in state and keeps the decoded key only in JavaScript memory.
- If the Management Center sign-in was not saved, the page asks the user to sign in there with **Remember password** enabled; it never displays a separate key field.
- Auth tokens are read through CPA host APIs and are not returned to the browser.
- The plugin rejects nested or unsafe auth filenames before writeback.
- State files are written with owner-only permissions.

Please report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's security advisory feature rather than a public issue.
